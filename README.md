## Install

```sh
npm install -g comux
```

Or try it without a global install:

```sh
npm exec comux@latest -- doctor --json
```

## Quick Start

```sh
cd /path/to/your/project
comux
```

Press `n` to create a new pane, type a prompt, pick one or more agents (or none for a plain terminal), and comux handles the rest — tmux pane, git worktree, branch, and agent launch.

Press `u` to open rituals: reusable setup recipes for starting a project with a known pane layout. Built-ins include Start Coding, Terminal First, Review Stack, Release Check, and Fix OpenClaw. You can also save project rituals and attach a default ritual to a project.

Open the selected pane menu with `m` when you want to inspect, merge, create a PR, attach another agent, or clean up.

New to tmux? Run:

```sh
comux doctor
comux doctor --fix
```

`comux doctor` checks tmux, git, clipboard/navigation support, comux session styling, and the comux-managed tmux config block. `--fix` applies safe repairs, backs up an existing `~/.tmux.conf`, and only edits the block between `# >>> comux` and `# <<< comux`.

The doctor output also calls out supported agent CLIs and the Coven boundary:

- Without an agent CLI, comux can still open and manage plain terminal panes.
- With a supported agent CLI, comux can launch agent panes from prompts.
- Without Coven, comux still manages tmux panes, worktrees, merge, PR, settings, rituals, and local file browsing.
- With a local Coven daemon, comux can also list, open, and launch scoped Coven harness sessions.

## What it does

comux creates a tmux pane for each task. Every work pane gets its own git worktree and branch so agents work in complete isolation. When a task is done, open the pane menu with `m` and choose Merge to bring it back into your main branch, or Create GitHub PR to push the branch and file a pull request.

- **Worktree isolation** — each pane is a full working copy, no conflicts between agents
- **Agent support** — Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cline CLI, Gemini CLI, Qwen CLI, Amp CLI, pi CLI, Cursor CLI, Copilot CLI, and Crush CLI
- **Multi-select launches** — choose any combination of enabled agents per prompt
- **AI naming** — branches, pane labels, and commit messages can be generated automatically
- **Smart merging** — review, auto-commit, merge, PR, and cleanup flows stay explicit
- **macOS notifications** — background panes can send native attention alerts when they settle and need you
- **Built-in file browser** — inspect a pane's worktree, search files, and preview code or diffs without leaving comux
- **Pane visibility controls** — hide individual panes, isolate one project, or restore everything later without stopping work
- **Multi-project cockpit** — add multiple repos to the same session and switch scope from the sidebar
- **Rituals** — open, save, and attach reusable project setup recipes without restoring brittle tmux snapshots
- **Fix OpenClaw cockpit** — a built-in ritual opens Coven repair, verification, diff watch, and session panes so rescue work stays visible
- **Coven bridge** — list, open, and launch Coven-managed sessions when a local Coven daemon is available
- **Lifecycle hooks** — run scripts on worktree create, pre-merge, post-merge, and more

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `n` | New pane (worktree + agent) |
| `t` | New terminal pane |
| `u` | Open or manage rituals |
| `e` | Rename the selected pane/thread or project inline |
| `j` / `Enter` | Jump to pane |
| `m` | Open pane menu |
| `f` | Browse files in selected pane's worktree |
| `x` | Close pane |
| `h` | Hide/show selected pane |
| `H` | Hide/show all other panes |
| `p` | Add project to sidebar |
| `P` | Show only the selected project's panes, then show all |
| `r` | Reopen closed worktrees for the active project |
| `s` | Settings |
| `l` | Logs |
| `?` | Keyboard shortcuts and help |
| `q` | Quit |

When focus is inside a work pane, tmux receives your keys instead of comux. Use `Ctrl-b` then `Left Arrow` to return to the comux sidebar. When mouse events are enabled, click a pane/thread/worktree row to select it and double-click a pane/thread/worktree name or project header to edit it inline. On macOS, `Alt+Shift+M` opens the focused pane menu when your terminal sends Option as Meta. In Terminal.app, enable **Settings > Profiles > Keyboard > Use Option as Meta key**. In iTerm2, use **Settings > Profiles > Keys > Left/Right Option Key > Esc+**.

## Requirements

- tmux 3.0+
- Node.js 18+
- Git 2.20+
- At least one supported agent CLI for agent panes (for example [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode), [Cline CLI](https://docs.cline.bot/cline-cli/getting-started), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Qwen CLI](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code), [Amp CLI](https://ampcode.com/manual), [pi CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent), [Cursor CLI](https://docs.cursor.com/en/cli/overview), [Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli), [Crush CLI](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush)). Plain terminal panes work without an agent CLI.
- [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/) (optional, for AI branch names, status analysis, and commit messages)

## Coven and OpenCoven

comux works as a standalone tmux/worktree cockpit. It also speaks to Coven when a local Coven daemon is available, so OpenCoven-managed harness sessions can appear beside normal comux panes.

Coven is the harness substrate. comux is the cockpit. OpenMeow and OpenClaw can sit above them as intake and orchestration layers.
